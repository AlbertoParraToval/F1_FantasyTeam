  "texto1":" When I was thinking about doing the ionic activity that the teacher suggested, I wanted to make an App that I have always wanted to have. As a fan of F1 since I was a little boy, I would have liked that in an App you could edit the drivers and put them in different teams to the ones they are in reality.",
  "Intro2":"How does this App work?",
  "texto2":" This App is divided into 3 pages, the 1st {{'Pilots' | uppercase}} where you will find a list of pilots where you can insert, modify and delete as you wish, a 2nd page {{'Teams' | uppercase}} where you will also find another list where you can modify, insert and delete the data of the same, and a 3rd page that will focus on linking the previous two but following the same functionality, ie, delete, modify and insert."
